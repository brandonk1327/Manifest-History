        <p>Our goal of this project is to creative an interactive map to assist people with learning history as it happened. The user will be able to interact with the map using pins that can be activated by hovering or clicking. Our current span of history only includes the 19th century and a limited amount of pins per year. </p>
        <p>We do not own any of the information or historical texts that are displayed on our webpage, but are just acting as a gateway for people to easily view and explore it. Since this website is a project for our Sophomore Project class at Oakland University our site is not monetized and is for our educational purposes only.</p>
